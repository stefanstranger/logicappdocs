# Introduction

This solution contains scripts to generate technical documentation for <u>Azure Logic Apps</u> and <u>Power Automate Flows</u>. It uses PowerShell to retrieve the Logic App or PowerAutomate Flow and creates a Markdown file with the flow in a Mermaid Diagram and tables of the actions and connections used in the flow.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run the script. The script will prompt you for the parameters. It will then create a Markdown file in the directory you provided when running the script.

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stefanstranger/logicappdocs.git
```

## Run the New-LogicAppDoc.ps1 PowerShell script to create the Markdown file for an Azure Logic App

Navigate to the folder where you have cloned the repository and run the New-LogicAppDoc.ps1 script.

```powershell
# Authenticate to Azure where the Azure Logic App is located
Login-AzAccount -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId>

# Run the script
# Example:
#  .\src\New-LogicAppDoc.ps1 -SubscriptionId 'dfc1f10c-a847-4250-bde8-93c3d6c53ea0' -ResourceGroupName 'jiraintegration-demo-rg' -LogicAppName 'logic-jiraintegration-demo' -OutputPath 'c:\temp' 
.\src\New-LogicAppDoc.ps1 -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId> -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -LogicAppName <LogicAppName> -OutputPath <OutputDirectory>
```

## Run the New-PowerAutomateDoc.ps1 PowerShell script to create the Markdown file for a Power Automate Flow

Navigate to the folder where you have cloned the repository and run the New-PowerAutomateDoc.ps1 script.

To retrieve the Power Automate Environment Id, you can login to your Power Automate Portal in your browser via https://make.preview.powerautomate.com/ and copy the environment id from the URL.

# Example:
#  .\src\New-PowerAutomateDoc.ps1 -EnvironmentName '839abcd7-59ab-4243-97ec-a5b8fcc104e4' -PowerAutomateName 'Notify of Canceled Meetings'
.\src\New-PowerAutomateDoc.ps1 -EnvironmentName <Power Automate Environment Id> -PowerAutomateName <Power Automate Flow Name>
```
